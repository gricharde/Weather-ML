# Weather-ML

### Project Background

ClimateWins wants you to assess the tools available to categorize and predict the weather in
mainland Europe. It’s concerned with the increase in extreme weather events, especially in the
past 10 to 20 years. However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and
planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it
hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.


### Objective
In this project, you’ll use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change
while working as a data analyst at a European nonprofit organization.
